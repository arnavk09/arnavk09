 I'm Arnav Katgeri, a 19 y/o Web Developer in the making. My areas of interest are <b>C++, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript and the MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node.js) Stack</b>. 
 I'm also good with Java and OOPS concepts. I enjoy challenging myself and making sure I move outside my comfort zone and pick up projects that are challenging yet fun 
 and teach me something new. This is complemented by my self learning ability that
 allows me to stay on top of things.
